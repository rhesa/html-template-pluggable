ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template 2.7

HTML::Template - a Perl module to use HTML Templates

CHANGES

   - New Feature: Added javascript escaping with ESCAPE=JS. (Craig Manley)

   - Bug Fix: Improved cache keying to be sensitive to options which
              alter the compilation of templates (path, search_path,
              loop_context_vars and global_vars).  Calls to new() with
              different settings for any of these options will no longer pull
              incorrect cached objects.

   - Bug Fix: Added code to detect broken Perl 5.8.0 installs
              during installation (i.e. Redhat 8 and 9).

   - Bug Fix: Fixed parsing of ESCAPE='URL' (Paul Baker)

   - Bug Fix: Added check for empty filename passed to new().

   - Test Fix: Migrated tests to Test::More.  This will allow the
               easier introduction of new tests and the use of
               Devel::Cover. (Gabor Szabo)

DESCRIPTION

    This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural. It
    extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
    <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF>, <TMPL_ELSE> and <TMPL_UNLESS>.
    The file written with HTML and these new tags is called a template. It
    is usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
    someone else! Using this module you fill in the values for the
    variables, loops and branches declared in the template. This allows you
    to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate in the
    Perl script.

    This module is licensed under the GPL. See the LICENSE section below for
    more details.
